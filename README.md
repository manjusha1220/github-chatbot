# github-chatbot

Hello! This is team Fab 5
This chatbot is developed using IBM Watson Services, called COVID-Chatbot, for COVID-19 assistance that communicates with a citizen to increase his/her consciousness towards the real danger of this outbreak.
The messages delivered from COVID-Chatbot and its way of communication could
possibly help to slow the COVID-19 spread.

The project is designed to keep citizens away from hospitals if possible, to prevent the spread of the virus, and help overloaded caregivers.

Although our COVID-Chatbot cannot replace experienced physicians and nurses, they certainly can prove helpful when hospitals are overloaded, and when citizens have medical questions while needing to stay at home.
The coronavirus disease has affected lives of people around the world. 
Our COVID-Chatbot is used to know about the symptoms of coronavirus and precautions to avoid the coronavirus.
This project is helps the citizens to protect him/her self from coronavirus.
